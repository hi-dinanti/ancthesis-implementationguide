Title: "Obstetric Status in GPA (Observation)" 
Description: "Observation representing obstetric [GPA#] status of antenatal care patient as reported in a survey. Gravida represents total number of pregnancies, parity represent number of times a woman has given birth to a viable offspring (parity), abortus represent the number of miscarriages and/or abortions."

The patient, or group of patients, location, or device this observation is about and into whose record the observation is placed.

* subject ^comment = "One would expect this element to be a cardinality of 1..1. The only circumstance in which the subject can be missing is when the observation is made by a device that does not know the patient. In this case, the observation SHALL be matched to a patient through some context/channel matching technique, and at this point, the observation should be updated."
